get into weird territory when only one point remains in tier
point logic on image resize *still* bad...
    based on image shrinking (no resize) then growing again?
    to recreate: edit from scratch, delete nonstart point, try to add it back
for premade levels, make sure internal point (5,5) on all tiers maps to the same game point coords

adding a start or end should unset the previous one
add lock mechanics
add editor mode for defining point properties such as portals, powers, etc
add "wire" paths + gfx for powering points on
figure out what powers should do
add settings submenu for key bindings
add gpad version that handles keyboard input
add ability for menu items to have things other than raw text
add sound fx and music
