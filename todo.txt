add key/lock mechanics
figure out what powers should do
adding points deletes the portal point child sprites;
    they probably get killed when the image is remade
add settings submenu for key bindings
add ability for menu items to have things other than raw text
add editor mode for defining point properties such as portals, powers, etc
add intra-level warp nodes + gfx
Make sure point emitters turn off while tier is inactive
Make sure the tier that fades out still gets all its groups' visibilities disabled
Make notifier broadcasts to all tier items when tier becomes in/active
